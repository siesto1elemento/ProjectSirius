## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Vision
Project Sirius aims to be the leading financial analysis platform for the Indian stock market, empowering investors and analysts with intelligent, automated, and comprehensive data insights.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
Financial analysts and serious long-term investors need access to deep, accurate, and timely information about publicly listed Indian companies. Existing solutions are often expensive, have cumbersome user interfaces, or require significant manual effort to collate data from disparate sources. Project Sirius will solve this by deploying an intelligent AI agent to automate the entire data gathering and presentation process, saving users time and enabling them to make better-informed decisions.

### 1.3. Product Overview
Project Sirius is a web-based platform that provides two primary functionalities:
*   **Automated Company Reports:** Generate comprehensive, on-demand reports for any company listed on the Indian stock exchanges.
*   **Conversational AI:** An interactive chat interface allowing users to ask specific financial questions about companies and receive instant answers.

The core unique selling proposition (USP) is the AI agent that works in the background to fetch, process, and present all relevant information, powered by a robust web scraping infrastructure.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Long-Term Retail Investors:** Serious individual investors who conduct thorough research before investing and hold stocks for a significant period. They are often referred to as "value investors" or "fundamental investors."

    *   Handling different website structures.
    *   Managing scraper execution and scheduling.
    *   Implementing error handling and retries.
